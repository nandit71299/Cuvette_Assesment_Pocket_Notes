# Improvements Based on Previous Project Feedback

1. **Letter Spacing Issues**

   - Corrected letter spacing by implementing the values from the Figma design.

2. **Font Size Adjustments**

   - Resolved font size discrepancies by adhering to the specifications outlined in the Figma design.

3. **Layout Adjustments (Padding and Margin)**

   - Instead of solely relying on Figma, I focused on creating a visually appealing layout. I utilized Tailwind CSS classes for padding and margins to ensure consistency across devices.

4. **Content Corrections**

   - Updated content to align with the Figma design.

5. **Improved Folder Structure**

   - Organized the folder structure efficiently by creating separate components and placing styles in a dedicated "styles" folder. Context files are now housed in a "context" folder, and pages are clearly organized in a "pages" folder.

6. **Naming Conventions**

   - Ensured adherence to camel case naming conventions for JSX and CSS modules.

7. **Addition of Semantic HTML**

   - Incorporated semantic HTML elements to enhance SEO and improve accessibility for users with disabilities.

8. **Inclusion of Required Attributes**

   - Added necessary attributes to elements where applicable.

9. **Figma Layout Compliance**
   - Applied precise pixel dimensions from Figma for fixed-size components, sections, and pages. For other elements, I used flexible layouts with percentages to enhance responsiveness on mobile devices.
